# RISC-V-Based Binary to Gray Code Converter

This project showcases the implementation of a **Binary to Gray Code Converter** using the **VSDSquadron Mini RISC-V SoC Kit**. The system utilizes the **CH32V003 microcontroller**, which is based on the **QingKe RISC-V2A core**, providing a **low-power, high-performance computing solution**.

The implementation is written in **C** and programmed using **PlatformIO and VS Code**. It leverages **GPIO pins** to take a **3-bit binary input** and convert it to its corresponding **Gray Code** using a simple **XOR-based algorithm**. The hardware setup consists of **LEDs and buttons** to visualize the binary-to-Gray Code conversion.

## Features:
- Utilization of **VSDSquadron Mini RISC-V SoC Kit** for efficient computation.
- **GPIO-based input and output handling** for real-time processing.
- **Mathematical implementation of XOR logic** for Gray Code conversion.
- **Code optimization for embedded systems** with minimal resource usage.
- **Demonstration video attached** showcasing the working prototype.
