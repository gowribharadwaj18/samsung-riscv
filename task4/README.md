# Task 4: Progress Overview

- **Configured** the **Verilog netlist** and **testbench files** for simulation setup.  
- Established a **simulation environment** using **Icarus Verilog (iverilog) and GTKWave**.  
- Executed **functional simulations** to validate the **RISC-V Core's behavior**.  
- Captured and analyzed **waveform outputs** to ensure accurate core operation.  
- Compiled a **C program** with **RISC-V GCC**, testing **-o1 and -ofast optimizations**.  
- Examined **object dumps** to compare performance across optimization levels.  
- Uploaded **waveform snapshots, simulation results, and compiled binaries** to **GitHub** for documentation and collaboration.
